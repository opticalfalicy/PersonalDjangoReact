Stretch: Take this off of Django cause it sucks lol, switch to LESS,

Backend on root directory...
	-actual react app in src folder
	-swedishgoodbye contains central django elements.
	-Procfile is configured with settings.py
	-Organize directories

yarn start in src folder...
	-To open frontend
	-Opens to a mostly blank screen, find out why it's not going to the home page, or why the home page isn't the root url.

Find out how to start the backend...
	-remember how Django works.

		-pipenv shell
		-python manage.py runserver

Home and About pages feel disproportionate

No other pages work yet

About Component:
	
	-Do something way better with the page's text. Sucks right now.

CSS:
	-Consolidate / organize stylings

Implement Portfolio, Music, Contact pages.

Brainstorm navbar improvements. Functional, but feels off.3
